How red* is smallant's face?

In it's current state, the file "generate_reddit_post.py" will recreate the post you see on reddit

While it's only 200 lines, it is a little... obfuscated. 
In the next 24 hours after the reddit post it should be much clearer how this works and how to make your own with your own video and keyframes

GeneratePlots.py should generate the graph you see for a set of keyframes

JustPlayVideo.py should show an example of how to view a given MP4 with python commands


*it's not actually measureing red-ness in my post. it's the primary component after running PCA (primary component analysis). You get fairly similar graphs if you just graph hue, however PCA seems to create a smoother results with less accurate keyframes
